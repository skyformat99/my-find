MYFIND is a light implementation of find(1).

Overview :

  Myfind is the second projet realised during the first semester of ING1.
  Its goal is to mimic as close as possible the behavior of find(1).
  It was realised in two weeks.

I) Building executable
  
  In the root directory type "make" followed by one of the following keywords:
  * all   : Produces the myfind binary
  * test  : Produces the binary if not already made and run the tests suite
  * doc   : Generates documentation
  * clean : Deletes everything produced by make

II) Usage

  In the root directory:
  ./myfind [-d] [-H] [-L] [-P] [files] [expression]

  Options     : -d: process directories content before directory itself
                -H: does not follow symlinks except if given in command line
                -L: follows symlinks
                -P: never follow symlinks
  expressions : Each of these can be separated by operator
                Tests     : -name, -type
                Action    : -print, -exec, -execdir
                Operators : -o, -a, '!', '(', ')'
