[x] make a better make file
[x] start documenting with doxygen
[x] parse command
[x] verify -d option really works
[x] take care of -L simlink
[x] create simlink in test suite
[x] take care of -H
[x] Valgrind to see if problem with lstat
[x] test on PIE if test suite also creates link in link
[x] find out if arg can be given as -Ld of -L -d
[x] options overide each other
[x] check memory leaks
[x] find out if expressions can be given as only arg of find
[x] yes they can, implement it now
[x] remember to free the parsed list of expre
[ ] check if first expr is valid
[x] RECODE MEMCPY AND STRCPY
[x] replace FNM_PATHNAME by FNM_FILE_NAME
[x] in eval, pop twice, than call func
[ ] MORE THEN 25L:parse_arg,format expr, isvalidexpr
[x] free everything when errx
[ ] remove -g in makefile and fsanitize=address!
[x] append -a after -print when not at the end
[x] fnmatch doesn't match glowbing
[x] add parenthesis before -a -print
[ ] test with every fsanitize possible
[x] -print -o -print should only pring once
[ ] delete all trailing white space
[ ] more coherent indent
[x] fix problem with get_arg and make an other file for these functions
[ ] problem exec return value and print
[ ] see error message for exec unknown command;
[ ] just -print should print
[x] -exec -a -exec should execute in the other order
[x] see what's wrong with \( -name tests -o -type f \) -a -name TODO
[ ] see what's wrong with \( -type f -print \) -print
[x] do not execute if -a no and -o yes
[ ] fix test suite
[ ] tcheck that no zombies
[ ] continue to reduce format_expr and check if two new functions working
[ ] put new function in new file
[ ] check if parenthesis close
[ ] -a after parenthesis
[ ] exec alone misses operator
